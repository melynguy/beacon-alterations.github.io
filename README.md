Beacon Alterations Marketing Website
Team 4 will be collaborating with a client, Beacon Alterations, to create a marketing website. We plan to interview the client to work to design and create a new marketing platform and brand.

We plan to use vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as a CSS framework (to be determined). Additionally, we will include MapBox, as well as the creation of brand logos.
