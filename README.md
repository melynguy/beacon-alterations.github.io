Beacon Alterations Marketing Website
Team 4 will be collaborating with a client, Beacon Alterations, to create a marketing website. We will interview the client on specifications for their site and introduce a mock-up before we implement the design. Before implementation we will also discuss logo design and branding for their business.

We plan to use HTML, CSS, Javascript (JQuery) as well as MaterializeCSS. Our team will be using Pixabay images, Materialize icons as well as creating our own images, logos and icons for this site.
